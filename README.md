# namaste-react

_Best practice:_
Keep each component in separate files
Keep everything in src file
Any file should not be more than 100 lines

_Exports:_
Default: export default Component | import Component from "path"
Named Export: export const Component | import {Component} from "path"

// multiple exports: Named export

_React Hooks_
(Normal utility JS, functions written inside react script by Facebook Developer)

- useState(): Super powerful react variables
- useEffect()
